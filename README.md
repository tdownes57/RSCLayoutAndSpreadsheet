Desktop & web-application (ASP.NET mvc) system for WYSIWIG design and printing of member/employee IDs.
Contains many support libraries related to design, and a spreadsheet intended 
for member/employee ID-related information with Undo/Redo operations.
The application integrates the member/employee data (as managed by the spreadsheet) 
into the printing of each member/employee's physical ID card (a.k.a. ID badge).
