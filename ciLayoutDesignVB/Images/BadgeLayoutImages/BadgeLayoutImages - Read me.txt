Badge Layout Images - Read Me 

This folder (Images\BadgeLayoutImages) is for storing badge layouts, not in XML, 
  but in Image form (Jpeg).

This will allow the user to quickly see what the Layout looks like, in particular 
   when reviewing multiple layouts.  

This will allow the user to pick among >1 attempt at designing the right badge, 
   with the look & information that is required.  Especially if a year has gone 
   by since the previous year's badge. 

The images will probably be full-sized and will probably be named via the 6-digit Guid 
   which is associated with the Elements (or perhaps "Layout") cache.
