ReadMe.txt

This folder ("Originals" under folder "Images\BackgroundImagesUploaded") is used to store 
the original form of any images you have uploaded via the "Upload Background Image" menu item
(or button).

After uploading, an original image can be re-selected (in case another image has 
since replaced it), without have to re-select it from your PC or laptop's
hard drive.  You can press or select "Select Background Image" and then "Originals" 
and then see the image among the other original uploaded image(s).
