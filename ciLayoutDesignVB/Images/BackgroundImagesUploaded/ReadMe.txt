This folder ("BackgroundImagesUploaded", under folder "Images"") is used to store any images you have 
uploaded via the "Upload Background Image" menu item (or button).

After uploading, an image can be re-selected (in case another image has 
since replaced it), without have to re-select it from your PC or laptop's
hard drive.  You can press or select "Select Background Image" and see 
the image among the other uploaded image(s).
