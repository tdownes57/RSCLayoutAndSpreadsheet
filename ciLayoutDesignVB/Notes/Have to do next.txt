Have to do next 
--------------------

Fix rotation (90 degrees) of element field controls.  

Add "Clear selected-controls selections" to the Design-Layout menu (not a right-click menu)

Add a "Copy Element" option in the Right-Click menu, in case the same field needs to appear in two places on the badge.

Add layout sections ????

Figure out why the "Apply" button doesnt work.
