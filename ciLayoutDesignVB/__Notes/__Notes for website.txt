Big idea for website....

   The website only needs to present one(1) moveable/sizeable element at a time.

   The webpage can refresh each time a non-active element is clicked, thus making 
   that newly-clicked element active in the newly-refreshed page....   and the prior 
   element is returned to its non-moveable state.
