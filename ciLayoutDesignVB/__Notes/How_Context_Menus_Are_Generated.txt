       Operations_EditSignature
       Operations_EditStaticText
4.  Select one of the aforementioned classes. 
5.  Open the code module.
6.  Notice that the procedure names have underscores in the Sub names. 
7.  Create a new Public Sub procedure, with a descriptive name & underscores separating the 
      words in the descriptive name.
8.  The parameters of the Sub must be (sender As Object, e As EventArgs), otherwise it won't work. 
8.  Place appropriate code into the class, to accomplish what you need to accomplish.
