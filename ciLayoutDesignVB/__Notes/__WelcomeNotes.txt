Welcome to RSC ID Card (formerly called ABC Badge) by R Software Consulting.

Thank you for helping us to test our software. 

Major known issues with RSC ID Card:

    1. Portraits are not functional. We do not yet have a fully-developed system for
     uploading photos of Card-Recipients (students, members, staff). 

    2. The spreadsheet for managing Recipient data has not exhaustively tested. 

    3. Conditional Expressions has not been released, or if so, is not ready for use. 
   Conditional Expressions will allow you to specify whether or not a graphic or text-label
   will appear for each ID Card in a batch (grouped set) of Cards. 
   (Stated differently, Conditional Expressions will allow Elements to appear for a subset 
   of Card Recipients (students, members, staff) whose field values satisfy the exact 
   specified value.  Conditional-Expression values are specified by you, our dear customer.)

We are early in our testing, not ready for beta testing, so at this time our software is
  not licensed to our customers.  But the copyright is ours, so please don't copy the software.

I welcome your feedback.  Thank you so much!!
