   ''The following False-valued Booleans are an attempt to fix an ambiguity which has 
    ''  been vexing my layout-design development for a long time... namely, the
    ''  ambiguity is as follows....
    ''Do I want all the various types of Elements (e.g. QR code) to be easily
    ''  (i.e. automatically) instantiated (and thus present in the layout design at run-time),
    ''  or would I eventually find it vexing & annoying?
    ''Sometimes I just want to work with a simple, unadorned layout... no bells & whistles.
    ''A related question is, if I finally don't want them to keep appearing incessantly,
    ''  how do I "turn them off" effectively? 
    ''Solution:  The new form FormTypesOfElementsToAdd, and the following
    ''  Boolean constants.-----5/4/2022 td
    ''  -----5/4/2022 td
