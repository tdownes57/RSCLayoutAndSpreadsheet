Steps to add an additional context-menu item to a context menu:

1.  Go to the Solution Explorer.
2.  Find the folder "ContextMenus".
3.  Find the following Classes:
       Operations_EditBack
       Operations_EditElement
       Operations_EditGroup
       Operations_EditQR
       Operations_EditSignature
       Operations_EditStaticText
4.  Select one of the aforementioned classes. 
5.  Open the code module.
6.  Notice that the procedure names have underscores in the Sub names. 
    ''Names of procedures in this module: 
    ''  Public Sub Open_Field_Of_Element_EE1011(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
    ''  Public Sub Choose_Background_Color_EE1010(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
    ''  Public Sub Open_Dialog_Font_EE1009(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
    ''  Public Sub ExampleValue_Edit_EE1006(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
    ''   Public Sub Open_OffsetText_Dialog_EE1007(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
    ''  Public Sub Border_Design_EE1000(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
    ''  Public Sub Rotate90_Degrees_EE1001(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
    ''  Public Sub How_Context_Menus_Are_Generated_EE1002(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) 
    
7.  Create a new Public Sub procedure, with a descriptive name & underscores separating the 
      words in the descriptive name.
8.  The parameters of the Sub must be (sender As Object, e As EventArgs), otherwise it won't work. 
8.  Place appropriate code into the class, to accomplish what you need to accomplish.
