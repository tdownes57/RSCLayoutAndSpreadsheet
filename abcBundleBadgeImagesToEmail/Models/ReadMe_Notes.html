    Entity Framework Core in ASP.NET Core 3.1 – Getting Started
    https://codewithmukesh.com/blog/entity-framework-core-in-aspnet-core/

    Entity Framework Core is a lightweight, extensible, open-sourced version of the Entity 
    Framework Data Access Technology built for .NET Core Applications. It is essentially a way 
    to read and write data in a flexible and easier way. EFCore is an ORM ( Object Relational Mapper) 
    built over ADO.NET that enables developers to access & store data much more efficiently without 
    compromising on the performance (Unless you write real poor code!). With this technology you no 
    longer will interact directly with the database, like you used to do with traditional SQL queries
    and SPs.
