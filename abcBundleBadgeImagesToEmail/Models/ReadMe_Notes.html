        Entity Framework Core in ASP.NET Core 3.1 – Getting Started
        https://codewithmukesh.com/blog/entity-framework-core-in-aspnet-core/
    </p>

    <p>
        Entity Framework Core is a lightweight, extensible, open-sourced version of the Entity
        Framework Data Access Technology built for .NET Core Applications. It is essentially a way
        to read and write data in a flexible and easier way. EFCore is an ORM ( Object Relational Mapper)
        built over ADO.NET that enables developers to access & store data much more efficiently without
        compromising on the performance (Unless you write real poor code!). With this technology you no
        longer will interact directly with the database, like you used to do with traditional SQL queries
        and SPs.
