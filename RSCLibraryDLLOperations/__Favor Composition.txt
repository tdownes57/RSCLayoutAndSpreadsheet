P.S. ""Favor composition over inheritance""--i.e. you should consider modifying an existing class 
(to include an additional object reference, if needed), before you create a subclass (subclassed 
from the existing class) which includes the same object reference.

Quote from the Gang of Four ("Software Design Patterns")

'Prefer composition over inheritance as it is more malleable / easy to modify later, but do not use 
a compose-always approach.' 

With composition, it's easy to change behavior on the fly with Dependency Injection / Setters. 
Inheritance is more rigid as most languages do not allow you to derive from more than
one type. So the goose is more or less cooked once you derive from TypeA.""
